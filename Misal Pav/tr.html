Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in another pan. Crackle 1 teaspoon of 
mustard seeds first at low to medium-low heat.You can use any 
neutral-flavored oil or peanut oil.Then add 1 teaspoon of cumin 
seeds. Saute for some seconds till the cumin gets golden.Add 
one large or medium-sized onion (chopped).Saute stirring often till 
the onions soften and turn translucent. Stir and saute for some 
seconds or till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.Add the 
remaining ground spices listed below:
¼ teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1 teaspoon cumin powder
½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper
1 to 1.5 tablespoons of goda masala (though not authentic but can 
swap with ½ to 1 teaspoon garam masala instead)
Stir with a spoon and mix the spice powders well. Keep the heat to a 
low so that the spices don’t get burnt.Then add the prepared tamarind
pulp.Simmer on low or medium-low heat till the raw aroma of the 
tamarind goes away.Drain the water from the pressure-cooked matki
sprouts and potatoes with a colander.Add the cooked sprouts and 
potatoes to the pan.Stir and add ¾ to 1 cup water or more water if 
required. Usually the misal curry is medium or thin in consistency. So adjust water according to the consistency you prefer, but do not make it very thin as this will dilute the flavors.Season with salt as required.Simmer the usal for 8 to 10 minutes on low heat with occasional stirrings. You can adjust the consistency by adding more or less water. On simmering, the usal consistency will thicken so keep this in mind while adding water.Lastly garnish with coriander leaves
